# Detail TTS

The model newly proposed three significant important methods to become the best practice of AR TTS. 
- Although RVQ is used, the actual training employs continuous features, I call it fake discretization. 
- A very simplified but highly effective diffusion method has been proposed, which I call Simple Diff.
- Both prefixed spk emb and prompt are used to get benefit from both Valle type inference and Tortoise type training.
